/// The ProcessorMode subconfig is used to determine how the processor should run in.
///
/// Depending on the mode, the processor decides which starting version to use and how to
/// track the last successfully processed version.
///
/// The following processor modes are supported:
/// - Backfill: The processor will backfill data from the starting version to the ending version and
///   track the last successfully backfilled version.
/// - Default: The processor will bootstrap from the starting version and track the last successfully
///   processed version. Upon restart, it should pick up from the last successfully processed version.1
/// - Testing: The processor will run in the testing mode. Checkpoints are not saved.
///
/// Using this subconfig in your main processor config is completely optional.
/// This subconfig is meant to help you  your processor in these different modes.
///
/// Example:
/// ```yaml
/// processor_mode:
///   type: "backfill"
///   backfill_id: "my_backfill_id"
///   initial_starting_version: 0
///   ending_version: 100
/// ```
